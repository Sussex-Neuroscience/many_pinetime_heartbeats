# Documentation for the Many_Pinetimes_Heartbeats Project
Welcome to the documentation folder for the **Many_Pinetimes_Heartbeat** project. This project is initially to support an art installation where PineTime watches being used by visitors will send information (Heart rate, xyz, step count) to a computer and this will be used to control what is being shown to visitors (audio visual projections, etc).
